# /vrpg/ makes a jrpg

We are doing a RPG maker game. If you think that's dumb, then you're free to not participate and just shitpost.
A new thread will be made on the first of every month. Requests for sprites, dialogue, maps etc will be listed.
If the thread hits the bump limit, a new one will be made, but if it dies it goes back to the first of next month.
Dead thread =/= Dead game. 

## Art
- Tan busts and sprites for the Board tans and game genre tans.
- Tile sets for maps
- Main Player sprites

## Music
- MUSIC EVERYWHERE

## Coding
- JavaScript scripts to expand the mechanics of our game.

## Slave labor
- Placing resources into the repository and correctly labeling them for use.

## Leadership
Agent Orange is heading the project. 
He'll regularly post what he'd like help with, dialogue, assets needed, his technological incompetance, and so forth. 
The list will be available in this document as well.
The game is being made for you, not him. If there's something you don't like, tell him how to fix it.

## Shitposters
- Lazy "Ideasguys" for inspiration
- people need to say we aren't going to finish so we can make them feel dumb when we finish
- people getting mad that their idea wasn't popular and making anger rants so we can laugh at them.
