-Not much today. Spent a few hours learning about sprites and actors. Sounds ridiculous but I'm new to alot of this. 
-Working on Wes' new frames. Should be done soon. Wes will no longer be a manlet following.

Thread died! Fuck! But I'm not going to quit.
Shit, I'm going to miss Cioc Saz. He was a nice guy.  
If you're reading this, and I doubt anyone is, development will continue. 
Was going to do Wes sprites today. This threw me off track. 

9/13/20
- No changes today. 9 hour shift. 

9/14/2020
- I had been working on the Wes sprites for an hour but piskel crashed and I lost everything. No changes today. I'm really fuckin sad.

9/15/2020
- Wes Overworld Sprites are complete. 
- Wes no longer has a sword in his overworld sprite. Sorry. I couldn't make it look good. 
- 8 frame plugin works, and Wes' buttery smooth overworld sprites have now been implemented into the game. 
- Wes is no longer a manlet, sizing issues are now resolved. 
Next step is to redo the intro. 
With Wes' sprites finished, I can do that bit about him clipping into the floor. 

9/16/2020
- Created sprites of Wes clipping into the floor for the intro. 

9/17/2020
- Good headway on the intro. Got all the bits leading up to the creature breaking in. 
- Wes floor clipping sprite sheets are now in game
- Added a tombstone in the village to mark future location of cemetary.
- Still not sure how to link a playable build, but I will figure it out. 

9/18/2020
- More work on the intro. A bit more than half done now. Almost all the assets are placeholders though...

9/23/2020
Sorry about the hiatus. I had a problem, unrelated to the game. I'll keep working the game, though I'll likely focus on weekdays going forward. 
- Intro is almost done. Interior portion is functionally complete, though as with everything, it will require touching up later.
- Now working on exterior segment of Intro. 
- Added an option to view only the exterior segment at the beginning, for convenience while testing.
