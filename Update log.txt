- Still learning the all the bells and whistles of rpgmaker, but am more competant
- Added Titlescreen image
- Game begins inside village rather than the old overworld. 
- Updated the readme
- Currently redoing intro

9/10/2020
- Now have dialogue written for intro by generous anon
- Writing events for intro (this is my first time creating a cutscene so please have patience with me)
- Updating Wes' sprite to the oc one, but I need to make some frames myself as it was incomplete.

9/11/2020
-Not much today. Spent a few hours learning about sprites and actors. Sounds ridiculous but I'm new to alot of this. 
-Working on Wes' new frames. Should be done soon. Wes will no longer be a manlet following.

9/12/2020
Thread died! Fuck! But I'm not going to quit.
Shit, I'm going to miss Cioc Saz. He was a nice guy.  
If you're reading this, development will continue. 

9/15/2020
- Wes Overworld Sprites are complete. 
- Wes no longer has a sword in his overworld sprite. Sorry. I couldn't make it look good. 
- 8 frame plugin works, and Wes' buttery smooth overworld sprites have now been implemented into the game. 
- Wes is no longer a manlet, sizing issues are now resolved. 
Next step is to redo the intro. 
With Wes' sprites finished, I can do that bit about him clipping into the floor. 

9/16/2020
- Created sprites of Wes clipping into the floor for the intro. 

9/17/2020
- Good headway on the intro. Got all the bits leading up to the creature breaking in. 
- Wes floor clipping sprite sheets are now in game
- Added a tombstone in the village to mark future location of cemetary.
- Still not sure how to link a playable build, but I will figure it out. 

9/18/2020
- More work on the intro. A bit more than half done now. Almost all the assets are placeholders though...

9/23/2020
Sorry about the hiatus. I had a problem, unrelated to the game. I'll keep working the game, though I'll likely focus on weekdays going forward. 
- Intro is almost done. Interior portion is functionally complete, though as with everything, it will require touching up later.
- Tomorrow I begin working on exterior segment of Intro
- Added an option to view only the exterior segment at the beginning, for convenience while testing.

9/24/2020
- Disabling overworld music (flowing fields) in maps I'm working on, because the loop is making me lose my mind. Flowing fields. 
- Fixed an issue where the cutscene would play even when skipped
- Completed half the Exterior segment of Intro, should have the other half done tomorrow. 
- Also added some music from threads I had saved, but for some reason no one had put in.

9/25/2020
- Intro cutscene, Interior and Exterior, is complete. Still needs some scratches buffed out, but as a whole, it is done. 
- Example: Skip intro, you've got doubles of all the characters. I'll deal with that and the other issues.

9/26/2020
- Village now linked to castle, can converse with the King
Thinking it might be good to do away with the Chibi rpgmaker artstyle. Wes' different style gives the effect of him mogging everyone. 
Would be pretty straightforward, I just need to stretch the lower torsos of all the sprites in gimp. Time consuming though. 

9/28/2020
- Created new King cutscene. Again, all of it can be considered placeholder. If there are aspects that people don't like, it's easy to change dialogue.
- Offers 4 dialogue paths. Took a while. All of it can be tweaked as needed.
- Need to work out the kinks. Some issues with Jay spawning at undesired times still occurring.
- Might just work on cleaning things up and figuring out Github pages leading up to the 1st. 

9/30/2020
I've been going at it for a few hours and for the life of me I can't get a playable build working.
I keep getting this same error message I haven't been able to resolve. 
Holy fucking shit I did it. This is fucking fantastic. It's a beautiful night to be alive. 
Still having some challenges though. Sometimes it links the old one?

- Finished King dialogue

It stopped working... It started linking the old one again, and now it just 404s.
