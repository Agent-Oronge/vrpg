9/9/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Added Titlescreen image
- Game begins inside village rather than the old overworld. 
- Updated the readme
- Currently redoing intro

9/10/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Now have dialogue written for intro
- Updating Wes' sprite to the oc one, but I need to make some frames myself as it was incomplete.

9/15/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Wes Overworld Sprites are complete. 
- Wes no longer has a sword in his overworld sprite. Sorry. I couldn't make it look good. 
- 8 frame plugin works, and Wes' buttery smooth overworld sprites have now been implemented into the game. 
- Wes is no longer a manlet, sizing issues are now resolved.  

9/16/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Created sprites of Wes clipping into the floor for the intro. 

9/17/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Wes floor clipping sprite sheets are now in game
- Added a tombstone in the village to mark future location of cemetary.

9/23/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Intro is almost done. Interior portion is functionally complete, though as with everything, it will require touching up later.
- Added an option to view only the exterior segment at the beginning, for convenience while testing.

9/24/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Fixed an issue where the cutscene would play even when skipped
- Completed half the Exterior segment of Intro
- Updated music in Repository

9/25/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Intro cutscene, Interior and Exterior, is complete. Still needs some scratches buffed out, but as a whole, it is done. 

9/26/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Village now linked to castle, can converse with the King
Thinking it might be good to do away with the Chibi rpgmaker artstyle. Wes' different style gives the effect of him mogging everyone. 
Would be pretty straightforward, I just need to stretch the lower torsos of all the sprites in gimp. Time consuming though. 

9/28/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Created new King cutscene.
- Offers 4 dialogue paths. All of it can be tweaked as needed.

9/30/2020 (Agent Orange)
- New playable build
https://agent-oronge.github.io/vrpg/
- Finished King dialogue

10/4/2020 (ContracyCC)
- Added 6 maps (Map ID 31-37)
- Those maps use tilesets 8 and 9 (which are made by combining old tilesets)
- Some events and NPCs added on those maps. Modify them as you wish.
- Swtiches 41 and 42 used
- Variables 21-25 used

10/6/2020 (ContracyCC)
- Added custom tilesets by Pandamaru
- Improved maps 31-37 using new the tilesets
- Added life-sized horse and wagon
- Switch 43 used

10/7/2020 (ContracyCC)
- Improved the village
- Modified the intro to fit the new map
- Added door, waterfall and waterwheel sprites

10/8/2020 (ContracyCC)
- Improved the main house and the intro
- Remapped the Casino, Bar, Shop, School and House
- Swtich 44 used (This is to make house disappear when burned)

10/14/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Some minor fixes. Just really simple shit, like making it so Jay doesn't follow you when you skip the intro anymore. Clean up essentially.

10/15/2020 (Agent Orange)
- You can now change controls through options at the main menu. In case you'd prefer a WASD layout or just want something different.

10/19/2020 (Agent Orange)
That bit where Jay finds a coin in a crack has got me thinking. Might be fun to have it so you can send Jay into small tunnels to get things as a recurring mechanic.
- Going through all the archived threads to save all the ideas and art no one else did. I thought someone was saving it, but turns out no ideas had been written down since the 9th of August, and no art saved since then either.
- Destroyed House cutscene is complete. 
- Moe can now join the party.

10/20/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Gave Wes a visual indicator so he doesn't need to explain every time he loads a save. Also some misc cleanup.
Question to ask though- Should other people remember events that technically didn't occur because Wes loaded a save? How does time progress?

10/21/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Added Shopkeep portrait
- Added Playback by Nieve into the audio files. We could have a few notes play when Wes loads a save, or it could be a theme for someone wearing an Exo-Skele-Teen.

10/22/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Went through the Archives and saved all the maps from Mapanon that hadn't been saved, as well as all the art and music that hadn't been saved.
- Updated game icon to the custom vrpg icon
- Northern passages now allows you to travel to the Lost Forest upon speaking with Shopkeep. Lost forest needs a cleanup though. 
- Updated intro cutscene
