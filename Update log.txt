9/9/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Added Titlescreen image
- Game begins inside village rather than the old overworld. 
- Updated the readme


9/10/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Now have dialogue written for intro
- Updating Wes' sprite to the oc one, but I need to make some frames myself as it was incomplete.

9/15/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Wes Overworld Sprites are complete. 
- Wes no longer has a sword in his overworld sprite. Sorry. I couldn't make it look good. 
- 8 frame plugin works, and Wes' buttery smooth overworld sprites have now been implemented into the game.

9/16/2020 (Agent Orange)

9/24/2020 (Agent Orange)

- Updated music in Repository

9/25/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Intro cutscene is complete. 

9/26/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Village now linked to castle, can converse with the King
Thinking it might be good to do away with the Chibi rpgmaker artstyle. Wes' different style gives the effect of him mogging everyone. 
Would be pretty straightforward, I just need to stretch the lower torsos of all the sprites in gimp. Time consuming though. 

9/28/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Created new King cutscene.
- Offers 4 dialogue paths. All of it can be tweaked as needed.

9/30/2020 (Agent Orange)

10/4/2020 (ContraryCC)

10/14/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Some minor fixes. Just really simple shit, like making it so Jay doesn't follow you when you skip the intro anymore. Clean up essentially.

10/15/2020 (Agent Orange)
- You can now change controls through options at the main menu. In case you'd prefer a WASD layout or just want something different.

10/19/2020 (Agent Orange)
That bit where Jay finds a coin in a crack has got me thinking. Might be fun to have it so you can send Jay into small tunnels to get things as a recurring mechanic.
- Destroyed House cutscene is complete. 
- Moe can now join the party.

10/20/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Gave Wes a visual indicator so he doesn't need to explain every time he loads a save. Also some misc cleanup.
Question to ask though- Should other people remember events that technically didn't occur because Wes loaded a save? How does time progress?

10/21/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Added Shopkeep portrait
- Added Playback by Nieve into the audio files. We could have a few notes play when Wes loads a save, or it could be a theme for someone wearing an Exo-Skele-Teen.

- Updated game icon to the custom vrpg icon
- Northern passages now allows you to travel to the Lost Forest upon speaking with Shopkeep. Lost forest needs a cleanup though.

- Added some events that prompt Advis to tell you things you already know
- Attemping to find a solution to the map pngs being low res. 

10/27/2020 (Agent Orange)
I used Waifu2x to upscale the Parallax. Probably acceptable. It's not blurry anymore.
- Added NE Town Entrance for first Boss fight
- NE Town has proper collision boxes

10/28/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Created world map layout. Will continue to update it. Necessary to keep adding maps, the game should make sense geographically.
- The Southern exist of the first town will now be blocked off until we have something to put there. 
- Saved all the art from archived threads + Mapanon's pics, they've been added to the repo.

- Added Yanfly Battle animation plugin
- Added Shotgun sprites for Wes, Which now appears in battle, and a sideview battler template
- Fixed issue with icons. May need to scrap current hud. 
I've spent a while making it compatible with the current resolution but it still looks like shit and I'm not sure if it'd be possible to make it not look like shit.

11/21/2020 (Agent Orange)
- Added Yanfly plugins for Animated Enemies, Victory Aftermath, Leveling, Battle Engine core, and Enemy leveling.
